This agent based model relies on two files - ‘200925978 - ABM’ and the ‘agentframework’. Open these files within Spyder and ensure that the graphic settings are set to tkinker before running the code. 

Running the main code within ‘200925978 ABM’ will bring up a GUI from which the model can be run by clicking ‘run model’ within the menu bar. 

On running the model, agents within the environment will move around randomly, ‘eat’/remove the environment around them and share their store of environment with nearby agents that have lower stores.
